CS520-Team5 Implementation Changes - May 4, 2024
=============================================

1. Backend Setup and Integration
--------------------------------

New Files Created:
1. backend/controllers/obesityRiskController.js
   - Handles obesity risk prediction endpoint
   - Integrates Python script with Node.js
   - Manages data flow between frontend and Python model

2. backend/controllers/patientController.js
   - Manages patient data operations
   - Handles CRUD operations for patient records

3. backend/db/conn.js
   - MongoDB connection configuration
   - Establishes connection to CareCompass database

4. backend/obesity_model.py
   - Python script for obesity risk prediction
   - Uses scikit-learn for machine learning
   - Processes health metrics to predict risk levels

5. backend/package.json
   - Backend-specific dependencies
   - Scripts for running the server

6. backend/routes/obesityRiskRoutes.js
   - Defines routes for obesity risk prediction
   - Handles API endpoints

Modified Files:
1. backend/app.js
   - Added MongoDB connection
   - Configured Express server
   - Set up middleware and routes

2. backend/models/patient.js
   - Updated patient model schema
   - Added new fields for health metrics

3. backend/routes/routes.js
   - Integrated obesity risk prediction routes
   - Added new API endpoints

4. client/src/api/endpoint.js
   - Updated API endpoints
   - Added obesity risk prediction endpoint

5. package.json (root)
   - Added start script for the server
   - Updated dependencies

2. Key Features Implemented
---------------------------

1. Obesity Risk Prediction System
   - Endpoint: /api/obesity-risk/predict
   - Input: Health metrics (blood glucose, BMI, blood pressure, insulin dosage)
   - Output: Risk level and confidence score

2. MongoDB Integration
   - Connected to CareCompass database
   - Set up patient data storage
   - Implemented data models and controllers

3. Python Integration
   - Created virtual environment for Python dependencies
   - Installed required packages (scikit-learn, numpy)
   - Set up communication between Node.js and Python

3. Testing and Validation
------------------------

1. Server Testing
   - Verified server starts correctly
   - Confirmed MongoDB connection
   - Tested API endpoints

2. Prediction Testing
   - Tested with normal health metrics:
     {
       "bloodGlucoseLevels": 120,
       "bmi": 25,
       "bloodPressure": "120/80",
       "insulinDosage": 15
     }
   - Tested with higher risk metrics:
     {
       "bloodGlucoseLevels": 180,
       "bmi": 35,
       "bloodPressure": "150/95",
       "insulinDosage": 45
     }

3. Response Format
   {
     "riskLevel": "Low",
     "confidence": 0.67
   }

4. Technical Challenges Overcome
-------------------------------

1. Port Conflicts
   - Resolved EADDRINUSE errors
   - Implemented proper process management
   - Used lsof to find and kill processes on port 3000

2. Module Integration
   - Fixed ES module imports
   - Resolved Python dependency issues
   - Set up proper virtual environment

3. Data Flow
   - Established communication between Node.js and Python
   - Implemented proper error handling
   - Set up data validation

5. Version Control
-----------------

1. Branch Management
   - Created and switched to 'ansh' branch
   - Committed all changes
   - Successfully pushed to remote repository

2. Changes Committed
   - 12 files changed
   - 453 insertions
   - 54 deletions
   - 7 new files created

6. Error Logs and Solutions
---------------------------

1. Port in Use Error:
   Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
   Solution: Used lsof to find and kill process using port 3000

2. Missing Start Script:
   npm error Missing script: "start"
   Solution: Added start script to package.json

3. Module Export Error:
   SyntaxError: The requested module does not provide an export
   Solution: Fixed ES module imports and exports

4. Python Module Error:
   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'
   Solution: Created and activated virtual environment, installed dependencies

7. Final Implementation Status
-----------------------------

The system is now fully functional with:
- Working obesity risk prediction model
- Proper database integration
- Robust API endpoints
- Error handling and validation
- Clean code organization

All changes have been successfully pushed to the 'ansh' branch of the repository.
