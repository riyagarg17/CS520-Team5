Diabetes Risk Classifier Implementation Changes
Date: March 19, 2024

Files Modified:
1. backend/utils/modelPredictor.js
   - Added predictRisk function to spawn Python process
   - Implemented zone mapping (0: green, 1: yellow, 2: red)

2. backend/utils/predict.py
   - Created new file for model prediction
   - Added feature scaling using StandardScaler
   - Implemented error handling and logging
   - Added probability output for better debugging

3. backend/utils/test_prediction.py
   - Created test script for model predictions
   - Added feature scaling test
   - Implemented detailed logging of predictions

4. backend/controllers/patientController.js
   - Modified updateHealthDetails to include risk prediction
   - Added risk zone to response data

5. client/src/api/services/patientService.js
   - Updated updateHealthDetails to handle risk zone response

6. client/src/pages/PatientDashboard.jsx
   - Added dynamic risk zone display
   - Implemented color-coded zone status
   - Added contextual messages based on risk level

Required Files:
1. diabetes_rf_model.pkl - Trained Random Forest model
2. scaler.pkl - StandardScaler for feature normalization

Commands to Run:

1. Start Backend Server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   source venv/bin/activate  # Activate virtual environment
   npm start
   ```

2. Start Frontend Client:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

3. Test Prediction Script:
   ```bash
   cd backend/utils
   source ../venv/bin/activate  # Activate virtual environment
   python3 test_prediction.py
   ```

Required Python Packages:
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- joblib

Note: Make sure both model files (diabetes_rf_model.pkl and scaler.pkl) are in the root directory of the project.
